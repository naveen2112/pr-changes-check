# Roman to Integer

This is a problem-solving exercise for converting Roman numerals to integers.

## Problem Description

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, there are special cases where subtraction is used:
- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 15
- s contains only the characters 'I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M'.
- It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

## Running the Code

To run the sample tests:
```
python main.py
```

To run all test cases:
```
python test_program.py
```
To run all test cases with details:
```
python test_program.py -d
```
